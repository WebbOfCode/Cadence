# How to View Task Steps - Quick Guide

## The Issue

The "View Steps" button wasn't appearing because the tasks being generated didn't include the `steps` array.

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Updated the API** to ask for steps in generated tasks  
✅ **Updated the mock mission plan generator** to include steps in all tasks  
✅ **Compiled successfully** - dev server is running

## How to See "View Steps" Button

### Option 1: Complete the Onboarding Flow (Recommended)

1. **Go to onboarding:** http://localhost:3001/onboarding
2. **Fill out all steps:**
   - Name
   - ETS Date
   - Branch
   - MOS
   - Primary Goal
   - Location (optional)
   - VA Disability Claim (Yes/No)
   - GI Bill (Yes/No)
   - Discharge Type
   - Awards & Decorations (optional)
3. **Review and finish** - Click "Finish Setup"
4. **Go to dashboard** - You'll be redirected automatically
5. **Look for "View Steps"** - Click on any task card to see the button

### Option 2: Use Mock Data (If Available)

If you have a saved mission plan in localStorage, it should now show steps for all tasks.

## Why Steps Weren't Showing Before

**Root Cause:**
- The API's system prompt didn't ask for `steps` in the JSON response
- The mock mission plan generator didn't include steps in tasks
- Dashboard code was ready to display steps, but tasks didn't have them

**Solution:**
- Updated API system prompt to request steps array
- Updated mock mission plan generator to include steps
- Now all generated tasks include 5-6 specific, actionable steps

---

## Step Content

Each step is:
- ✅ **Specific** - Exact action to take
- ✅ **Actionable** - Clear verb and object
- ✅ **Concrete** - No vague language
- ✅ **Practical** - Based on real-world experience
- ✅ **Helpful** - Guides veteran through task completion

## Troubleshooting

### "View Steps" button still not showing?

1. **Clear browser cache** - Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
2. **Refresh the page** - F5 or Cmd+R
3. **Complete a fresh onboarding** - Start from http://localhost:3001/onboarding
4. **Check browser console** - F12 → Console tab for errors

### Steps look incomplete?

- This might happen if the AI response was truncated
- Try completing onboarding again
- The mock mission plan generator always includes complete steps

### Need to test with mock data?

- Use the mock-mission-plan.json file as reference
- It contains example tasks with full steps arrays
- The API now generates similar quality steps

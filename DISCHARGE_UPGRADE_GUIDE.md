## Discharge Upgrade Success Factors

- ✅ Post-discharge rehabilitation (education, employment, community service)
- ✅ Character references and letters of support
- ✅ Medical documentation (PTSD, TBI, mental health issues)
- ✅ Mitigating circumstances at time of discharge
- ✅ Documented discrimination or unfair treatment

### Weak Case Elements:
- ❌ Admission of guilt without mitigation
- ❌ No evidence of rehabilitation
- ❌ Repeated misconduct after discharge
- ❌ No supporting documentation

## Special Circumstances

### PTSD/Mental Health Issues
- Often grounds for discharge upgrade
- Get medical documentation from VA or private provider
- Include in your statement as mitigating factor
- Many successful upgrades based on undiagnosed PTSD

### Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
- Can affect decision-making and behavior
- Get medical evaluation
- Include as mitigating circumstance

### Military Sexual Trauma (MST)
- Can be grounds for upgrade
- VA provides MST-specific support
- Include in your case narrative

### Discrimination or Unfair Treatment
- Document any discrimination (racial, religious, sexual orientation, etc.)
- Include witness statements
- Strong grounds for BCMR appeal

---

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Timeline | Success Rate | Complexity |
|--------|------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| DRB (Self) | Free | 6-12 mo | 20-30% | Medium |
| BCMR (Self) | Free | 6-18 mo | 25-35% | High |
| Private Attorney | $1.5K-5K+ | Varies | 60-80%* | Medium |

*Success rates vary by discharge type and case circumstances

## Important Notes

### Outside JAG (Judge Advocate General)
- JAG provides free legal advice but represents military interests
- Private attorneys represent YOUR interests exclusively
- Private counsel often more effective for discharge upgrades
- Consider private attorney for serious discharges (BCD, OTH)

### No Time Limit for BCMR
- BCMR can be filed years after discharge
- DRB generally limited to 15 years
- Even old cases can be upgraded with strong evidence

### Multiple Attempts
- Can appeal DRB decision to BCMR
- Can refile if new evidence emerges
- Previous denials don't prevent future attempts

---

## Next Steps

1. **Determine Your Priority:**
   - Honorable/General: Focus on benefits
   - OTH/BCD/Dishonorable: PURSUE UPGRADE

2. **Choose Your Path:**
   - Free: DRB or BCMR (self-representation)
   - Professional: Private discharge upgrade attorney

3. **Gather Documentation:**
   - DD-214 and discharge papers
   - Character references
   - Post-discharge achievements
   - Medical documentation (if applicable)

4. **Take Action:**
   - Contact appropriate board or attorney
